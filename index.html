        <h1>A Softcover Book Report</h1>
        <h2>Moby-Dick (or, The Whale)</h2>
        
        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks
        like sone popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel
        <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short
        and affectionately irrevent book report on this classic American literature.

        <a href = "https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick"> <br/> <br/><em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
        by Herman Melville begines withe these immortal words.
        
        <p style = "margin-left: 50px;">
            Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse,
            and nothing particular to interest me in shore. I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery
            part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>

        After driving off his spleen (which <i>can't</i> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the water vein
        for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby-Dick (who━<em>spoiler alert!</em>━is a giant
        white whale) is the book itself.
